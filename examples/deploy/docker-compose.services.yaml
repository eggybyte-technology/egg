# Docker Compose configuration for application services
# This file defines the example microservices that depend on infrastructure
# Note: 'version' field is obsolete in Compose V2 and has been removed
#
# Architecture:
#   - Infrastructure services (MySQL) are defined in docker-compose.infra.yaml
#   - Application services (minimal-service, user-service) are defined here
#   - Both share the same external network (egg-network)
#   - The "orphan containers" warning about egg-mysql is expected and can be ignored

  egg-network:
    external: true
